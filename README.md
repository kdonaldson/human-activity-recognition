Some people have lost marks in previous courses for not making it easy for their reviewers to give them marks. Don't just make a tidy data set, make it clear to people reviewing it why it is tidy. When you given the variables descriptive names, explain why the names are descriptive. Don't give your reviewers the opportunity to be confused about your work, spell it out to them.

Based on interpreting column names in the features is an open question as to is the the entries that include mean() and std() at the end, or does it include entries with mean in an earlier part of the name as well. There are no specific marking criteria on the number of columns. It is up to you to make a decision and explain what you did to the data. Make it easy for people to give you marks by explaining your reasoning.
