The code book
Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data
Information about the summary choices you made
Information about the experimental study design you used
Some other important tips

A common format for this document is a Word/text file.
There should be a section called "Study design" that has a thorough description of how you collected the data.
There must be a section called "Code book" that describes each variable and its units.
The codebook still has the specific description of the tidy data file contents (and you mention that it exists and it's role in the ReadMe)

Yes, and it is really important you include it. Go back to quiz 1 and look at the codebook there for inspiration. Be sure it goes on github with the analysis script and the readme. People have lost major marks in previous sessions by having a brain-fade and forgetting about critical files so not getting the marks: you want a run_analysis R script, a ReadMe markdown document, a Codebook markdown document, and a tidy data text file (this last goes on Coursera).



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
